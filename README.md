It is currently a work in progress and it's mainly a parser but there are now tests


Running:
Currently this project is in development mode until we pass all the tests. 

Tests:
You can generate tests with the generatestubs.cfm file 

This project depends on [CommandBox](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox) which is quite a good way to get things running. 

To run the tests do :

	box install testbox

Then 

	box start
